Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, cisplatin, lomustine, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

It is not yet known whether standard-dose radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy after surgery is more effective than reduced-dose craniospinal (head and spine) radiation therapy plus either posterior fossa (back of the brain) boost or tumor bed (site of the tumor) boost radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy in treating medulloblastoma.This randomized phase III trial is studying standard-dose radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to reduced-dose craniospinal radiation therapy AND posterior fossa boost radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to tumor bed boost radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy in treating young patients who have undergone surgery for newly diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma.Contact: Ashley Bayne Phone: 352-265-0680 Ext: 48969",

This is a two part project. Part 1 is a naturalistic and observational review of patient care delivery via retrospective chart review and via prospective point-of-care documentation by caregivers. A waiver of the screening process has been requested. Part 2 is a survey and phone interview follow-up of patients following discharge from the inpatient facility. (Enrolling in Jacksonville, FL)",

This aim is reported as the Quality Adjusted FFP Year (QAFFPY) and as the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). The QAFFPY and QALY will be compared among treatment arms and to the literature as described in Section 1.6. 2.2.8 An exploratory aim is to evaluate the cost-utility of the treatment arm demonstrating the most significant benefit (in terms of the primary outcome) in comparison with other widely accepted cancer and non-cancer therapies. Cost-utility will be assessed by the EQ-5D among treatment arms to determine which therapy dominates. 2.2.9 An exploratory aim is to assess associations between serum levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and measures of cognition (as measured by the HVLT-R, Trail Making Tests, parts A & B, or the COWAT) and mood and depression (as measured by the HSCL-25). 2.2.10 To collect paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, serum, plasma, urine, and buffy coat cells for future translational research analyses\r\n2.2.11 An exploratory aim is to assess the relationship(s) between the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA SI) and urinary morbidity using the CTCAE v. 3.0 grading system.",

		"study_description": "RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can find cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus, sirolimus, and methotrexate after the transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

In a given patient, the Surpass System will be deemed effective if treatment with the flow-diverter results in complete occlusion of their aneurysm without clinically significant stenosis of the parent artery at one year.

Numerous investigations have shown a broad range of response to clopidogrel and patients with impaired clopidogrel response also have an increased risk of recurrent ischemic events. Platelets from diabetic patients tend to stick together more increasing the risk of having a heart attack or stroke when compared with patients without diabetes mellitus. Further, diabetes mellitus is the most important risk factor for developing renal failure. Importantly, the presence of impaired renal function in diabetes mellitus patients increases the stickier of your platelets, which thus lead a highest risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events. The mechanisms contributing to the greater magnitude of impaired clopidogrel response in diabetes mellitus patients with renal function compared with diabetes mellitus patients without renal function remain unknown. The purpose of this pilot in vitro investigation is to evaluate if there are differences in terms of platelet function, between diabetes mellitus patients with and without renal failure.",

		"study_description": "The purpose of this study is to find out the level of pulsation or vibration that is necessary to straighten front teeth faster when wearing clear aligners.  When teeth are straightened with braces or clear aligners, it has been shown that certain variables such as your age or your sex can change how fast your teeth will move.  Recently it has been shown that using a device that gives low level pulses or vibrations, front teeth will straighten faster in patients wearing braces. During the study participants will be exposed to two different levels of vibration. One may be detecstudies_contact, the other will not. The vibration device that will be used is the AcceleDent Aura.  The device has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as used in this study.
